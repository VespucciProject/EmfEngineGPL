EmfEngine 0.8 - GPL Version
===========================

This is a version of EmfEngine released under the terms of the GPL by its author, Ion Vasilev. It is based on the older version hosted on the QtiPlot sourceforge page. It has been modified to work with Qt5. On unix systems, it depends on the [libEMF library](http://libemf.sourceforge.net/). It will not be as complete as his commercial version, and if you would like to support his work, please purchase a commercial license from him [here](http://soft.proindependent.com/emf/pricing.html).
